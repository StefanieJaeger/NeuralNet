# NeuralNet

#### This is a base structure of a neural net that uses *genetic algorithm*.

It's mainly thought as a practical exercise for me to understand how a neural net works but will hopefully still be usable in later projects.

Number of input and output neurons, hidden layers and neurons in hiddenlayers plus bias can be specified.
It tries to find the perfect weight as a double through "evolution".
